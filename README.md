# Spacey3D

## Purpose 
This repository contains the code for Spacey3D that was built using JavaFX and Mavern. One of the biggest roadblock In Linear Algebra is having an intuitive visualization of spans, vector spaces, planes, etc. This software aims to ease this by allowing you to graph using spans than equations from traditional graphing calculators. I primarily used it when I ragequitted too hard on plane intersections and there was like 0 tools to help me visualize that aside from 3Blue1Brown videos. Hope this tool be somewhat useful.

## Installation 

First git clone the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/poytaytoy/Spacey3D.git
```

From here there are too approaches. From the root directory, if you are on Linux or Mac, install java onto your system and run 

```bash
java -jar spacey3d-0.0.1.jar
```

For window users, I have conveninetly placed `spacey3d.exe` to run it. Just click on it.
